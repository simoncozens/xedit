The plan is to produce a rich text editor widget in Javascript which
allows you to write arbitrary XML, displayed with CSS.

Development is only targeting Firefox >= 3.0 at the moment. If it works
in other browsers, great.

* Open xedit.html in your browser to get started.

* We're using contenteditable because designmode on iframes does require
  HTML. contenteditable can be used on any DOM.

* The editor gets configured through an XML config file (which tells you
  which buttons to put on the toolbar and what they do) and a CSS file
  which tells how elements are seen. The CSS file also determines e.g.
  if an element is block-level. 

* It's designed to support multiple UIs - plain HTML, XUL, any HTML widget
  library.

* I'm trying to keep the implementation clean and modular. I've waded
  through a bunch of other (non-XML) rich text editors and it hurt my
  head. I hope this one will be different.

Small jobs list:

* Support loading an XML document via JS
* Allow spacer elements in the buttonbar
* Allow creation of new paragraphs (may be a big job)
